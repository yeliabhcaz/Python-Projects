"""Description:

In this kata you should simply determine, whether a given year is a leap year or not. In case you don't know the rules, here they are:

years divisible by 4 are leap years
but years divisible by 100 are not leap years
but years divisible by 400 are leap years
Additional Notes:

Only valid years (positive integers) will be tested, so you don't have to validate them
Examples can be found in the test fixture."""

def isleap(year):
"""determines if the year is a leap year"""
  return (year%100!=0 and year%4==0) or year%400==0 # if year is not divisible by 100 and divisible by 4 return True else False unless year is divisble by 400
